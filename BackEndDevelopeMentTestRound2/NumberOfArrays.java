Alice has an integer Array A of N size. Now he challenges Bob to find the number of arrays B,
 satisfying the given conditions:

The length of array B = length of array A
1 <= B[i] <= A[i] (1<= i <= N)
B[i] != B[j] (1 <= i < j <= N)
Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 109 + 7.


Input Format

First line contains one integer N.
Second line contains N integers, denoting the array A.


Output Format

Output the number of arrays B modulo 109 + 7.


Constraints

1 <= N <= 2*105
1 <= A[i] <= 109


Sample Input 1

2

2 3


Sample Output 1

4



Explanation of Sample 1

The 4 Arrays, are as follows:

B = [1,2]

B = [1,3]

B = [2,3]

B = [2,1]
